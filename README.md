# 🌐 Cybersecurity Labs Repository (Hack The Box)

## Welcome to my Cybersecurity Labs Repository! 

This project captures my journey through Hack The Box labs, blending hands-on cybersecurity practice with learning, problem-solving, and collaboration. It’s not just about hacking—it’s about mastering skills like penetration testing, secure coding, system administration, and more, all documented in an organized and engaging way. 📚💻

## About This Repository
This repository serves as a personal knowledge hub for my work on Hack The Box, a leading platform for cybersecurity training. Expect detailed notes, scripts, and insights from HTB machines, challenges, and academy labs, covering network analysis, vulnerability assessment, scripting, and beyond. My goal is to learn, share, and contribute to the cybersecurity community. 

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into intuitive categories, each with a specific focus:

🖥️ Machines: Write-ups for HTB active and retired machines, detailing enumeration, exploitation, and system hardening.

🧩 Challenges: Solutions for HTB challenges (e.g., Web, Crypto, Forensics), showcasing creative problem-solving.

📖 Academy: Summaries and insights from HTB Academy modules on foundational and advanced cybersecurity topics.

🛠️ Scripts: Custom tools and scripts for automating tasks or solving labs.

📚 Resources: Curated references, cheat sheets, and tools for learning and collaboration.
